# Denoising Approaches in NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields)

## Abstract
Welcome to the Denoising Approaches repository for Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)! This repository is an exploration into enhancing scene reconstruction using three distinct approaches: modification of the NeRF pipeline, examination of mathematical noise properties in NeRF, and leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for denoising purposes. Our goal is to empower you with innovative techniques to refine the fidelity and accuracy of scene reconstructions within the NeRF framework.

## Code Structure

### 1. Modify the NeRF Pipeline
Revolutionize your NeRF pipeline by incorporating advanced techniques:
- **PDF Sampling:** [Access the Notebook](/CS-BDRP-nerf/tree/master/code_versions/tiny_nerf_pdf_enabled.ipynb)
   - Implement PDF-based sampling to optimize scene reconstruction.
- **Image Holdout:** [Explore the Notebook](/CS-BDRP-nerf/tree/master/code_versions/tiny_nerf_image_holdouts.ipynb)
   - Utilize image holdouts for enhancing NeRF performance.

### 2. Mathematical Properties
Uncover the underlying noise properties in NeRF for a deeper understanding:
- **Examine Noise:** [Dive into the Noise Analysis](/CS-BDRP-nerf/tree/master/examine%20noise)
   - Explore the mathematical properties inherent in the noise of NeRF.

### 3. Denoising and General Scripts
Effortlessly denoise your NeRF outputs and access helpful scripts:
- **Denoising Output and General Scripts:** [Get Started](/CS-BDRP-nerf/tree/master/general_scripts)
   - Apply denoising algorithms and find general scripts for optimization and visualization.

Each notebook provides comprehensive insights, implementation details, and execution instructions. Dive into these resources to enhance your understanding and implementation of NeRF denoising techniques.
